1)In this task we have to decode the given hashes by using hashcat(given in the description).
2)using a online hash identifier I got to know the type of hashes they are.
3)I searched how to use the hashcat command and used the command.(the command I used “hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt --show /Users/nikshepguni/rockyou.txt”)

4)I had problems with last hash but I found out it was my dumbness and figured it out.
