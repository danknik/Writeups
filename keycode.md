In this task you have to figure out what is his friend typing on his special keyboard(obviously the flag).
For this task I actually over thought everything and keycodes of java and ceasar cipher text but turns out that I had to just look at my keyboard.
In this task we just need to see the alphabets locked inside the given alphabets on our keyboard.
