In this task we get the flag when we decode the texts in the given file.
I searched online for what type of encryption it is. I got to know it was base64 encryption.
After that I searched for methods of decryption, I both couple of ways one them was on the terminal and another was online decompiler
I used the terminal command to decode the text
The command was “base64 --decode encoded.txt > decoded_output.txt”
I was dumb so I had to repeat this step around 13 times or something.
After all this I got the flag.
